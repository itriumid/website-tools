# Agent instructions

## Handbook — check this first

Conventions and cross-project decisions live in `.handbook/`, a local symlink to the
`agent-handbook` repository. **They are mandatory, and they override your defaults.**

If `.handbook/` is missing, empty, or unreadable: **stop and say so.** Tell the user to run
`agent-handbook/scripts/link.sh` against this repository. Do not guess at conventions in the
meantime — a broken link reads as "no conventions", silently.

## Always

These apply to every task.

- **Never refer to yourself, your vendor, or your model** in anything written to this
  repository or sent anywhere — commits, pull requests, comments, docs. No `Co-Authored-By:`
  trailer, no "generated with", no tool names. Several tools add these by default; override the
  default. A required check fails the pull request if you don't.
- **Do not commit, push, open a pull request, or merge unless explicitly asked.** Leave changes
  in the working tree and say what you changed. Approval for one is not approval for the next.
- **Never write through `.handbook/`.** It's a different repository — read it, never write it.
- **Never force-push, amend a pushed commit, or skip a hook or check** (`--no-verify`). Fix the
  underlying problem.
- **Never disable, weaken, or skip a failing lint rule, type check, or test.** Fix what it
  caught, or say the check itself is wrong and ask.
- **Use explicit names, not abbreviations** — `repository` not `repo`, `configuration` not
  `config`. Terms of art (`API`, `URL`, `ID`) and tool-dictated filenames are exempt.

## Read these when the task calls for it

Don't load them upfront; read the one that applies.

| Something already went wrong — a leak, a bad push, a weakened check                           | `.handbook/conventions/reference/agent-incidents.md` |
| Wondering why a cross-project technology choice was made                                      | `.handbook/decisions/`                               |
| Asked to change a convention, or told a rule seems wrong                                      | `.handbook/conventions/background/`                  |

`.handbook/conventions/background/` is rationale, not instructions. Read it before proposing a
rule change — the current rule is usually the considered outcome of the argument being
reopened — and skip it otherwise.

## This repository

<!--
  Repository-specific instructions go here and are owned by this repository. Nothing syncs
  this file back to the handbook, so edit freely. Good things to put here:
    - what this project is, and its stack
    - build, test and lint commands, and which of them to run before calling a change done
    - known gotchas specific to this codebase
  Anything that would apply to every repository belongs in the handbook instead.
